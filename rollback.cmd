	rem Steadier State command file \srs\rollback.cmd
	rem
	rem FUNCTION:
	rem Takes a boot-from-VHD system that's running off a child VHD
	rem named "\snapshot.vhd" and "rolls back" the system by deleting
	rem that snapshot.vhd and creating a new one.  Here are the detailed
	rem steps.
	rem 1) Deletes the old snapshot.
	rem 2) Creates a script for DISKPART to create a new one.
	rem 3) Using that, DISKPART creates that new snapshot.vhd.
	rem 4) Creates an OS entry in bcdedit or re-uses an
	rem    existing one.
	rem 5) The fact that this will create an empty snapshot.vhd and
	rem    create a BCD entry means that it can create the initial
	rem    snapshot.vhd if one does not exist.
	rem 6) Sets the new OS entry to be the default one.
	rem 7) Rollback can automatically reboot your system.  It does
	rem    that to enable the possibility of making a user's computer
	rem    "rollback-able."  The idea is that you can have the user
	rem    reimage his/her machine by just booting the system.
	rem 
	rem RESULT:
	rem In just a few minutes, depending on hardware capabilities, with
	rem no user interaction, the system would be rolled back and
	rem rebooted to a "pristine" copy of Windows.
	rem
	rem As a result, when you want to "reimage" a an employee's system
	rem back to your starting point -- image.vhd -- you need only say to
	rem employee, "please reboot the computer.
	rem Note on auto-reboot:  if you want rollback NOT to automatically 
	rem reboot, just create a file named "noauto.txt" in the \srs 
	rem folder, or in the root of any drive.
	rem
	rem REQUIREMENTS:
	rem
	rem 1) You have rebooted since running prepnewpc.cmd
	rem 2) Must have WinPE installed in the 1GB partition
	rem 3) Computer must have been booted from that on-disk WinPE so
	rem    that it's running on X:
	rem 4) PC must have the Steadier State support files on x:\srs
	rem 5) image.vhd, Win 7, 8, 8.1 or 10 image, must be in the root of
	rem    the physical drive
	rem 6) If you've run this before, then it'll wipe
	rem    %_phydrive%\snapshot.vhd. If you have not, it will create the
	rem    first snapshot.vhd
	rem 7) Thus far I'm assuming that image.vhd is on %_phydrive%.
	rem    %_phydrive% should point to the drive where image.vhd exists
	rem    as indicated by the :vhdcheck subroutine in startnet.cmd
