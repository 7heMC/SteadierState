REM
REM vdrive should point to the drive where image.vhd exists
REM That SHOULD be drive C: because System Reserved -- which
REM might otherwise snatch C: first -- contains WinPE and we're
REM booting WinPE from a hard disk, not a RAM drive, leading to
REM the interesting situation that we can pretty much assume that
REM System Reserved WILL have a drive letter... and it'll be X:.
REM
REM Steadier State command file \SDRState\rollback.cmd
REM
REM FUNCTION:
REM
REM Takes a boot-from-VHD system that's running off a child VHD
REM named "\snapshot.vhd" and "rolls back" the system by deleting
REM that snapshot.vhd and creating a new one.  More specifically,
REM 1) Looks to see that "image.vhd" is sitting in the root of the
REM    C: drive.  If not, it errors out and exits.
REM 2) Otherwise, it deletes the old snapshot.
REM 3) Then, it creates a script for DISKPART to create a new one.
REM 4) Using that, DISKPART creates that new snapshot.vhd.
REM 5) Next, it creates an OS entry in bcdedit or re-uses an
REM    existing one.  If it's got to create a new one, it does it
REM    ex nihilo rather than copying an existing entry and modifying
REM    it -- best to leave as little to chance as is possible. 
REM 6) The fact that this will create an empty snapshot.vhd and create
REM    a BCD entry from nothing means that you can ALSO use rollback
REM    to set up your FIRST snapshot.  All you need is a system with
REM    an "image.vhd" in its root and rollback.cmd.  Just run rollback
REM    and in a trice you'll have your snapshot and your OS entry.
REM 7) Rollback sets the new OS entry to be the default one.
REM 8) Finally, rollback automatically reboots your system.  It does
REM    that to enable the possibility of making a user's computer
REM    "rollback-able."  The idea is that if you rename the current
REM    OS entry for WinPE (which is called "WinPE" by default) to
REM    "Roll back" and then tell startnet.cmd to run rollback on startup,
REM    you can have the user reimage his/her machine by just booting
REM    the system and choosing "Roll back" rather than "Windows 7."
REM    that would cause the user's system to boot WinPE, which would run
REM    rollback.cmd, which would then cause a reboot.  Result:  in just
REM    about five to seven minutes, with no user interaction save for
REM    choosing "Roll back," the system would be rolled back and rebooted
REM    to a "pristine" Windows 7.
REM
REM    As a result, when you want to "reimage" a an employee's system
REM    back to your starting point -- image.vhd -- you need only say to
REM    employee, "please reboot the computer and, when you see the 
REM    Boot Manager menu, choose "Roll Back Windows," press Enter and
REM    just walk away.
REM
REM    Note on auto-reboot:  if you want rollback NOT to automatically 
REM    reboot, just create a file named "noauto.txt" in the \SDRState 
REM    folder, or in the root of any drive between C: and N:
REM
REM ROLLBACK.CMD
REM
REM Sets up a system to boot from snapshot, deleting an old snapshot first if it exists
REM Deletes old snapshot.vhd, creates new snapshot.vhd, creates a new BCD entry for 
REM the new snapshot.vhd if necessary, and if not then just re-uses it
REM Finally, it auto-reboots WinPE so your rolled-back system comes up automatically
REM unless you have created a file x:\SDRState\noauto.txt in the WinPE \windows
REM folder or in the root of any drive between C: and N:... then WinPE stays up
REM
REM SETUP/ASSUMPTIONS:
REM
REM WILL NOT RUN RELIABLY FROM PREPNEWPC.CMD!!!
REM You must first run prepnewpc.cmd batch file, then reboot and
REM then it's okay to run this.
REM ????  is there a way to check for/automate that??? ???
REM
REM Requirements
REM 
REM (1) Must have WinPE installed in the 1GB partition, booted from it (X:)
REM (2) Computer must have been booted from that on-disk WinPE so that it's running on X:
REM (3) PC must have the support Steadier State files on x:\SDRState
REM (4) image.vhd, a Win 7 image, must be in the root on C:
REM (5) if you've run this before, then it'll wipe %vdrive%\snapshot.vhd
REM     But if not, no problem, it'll create the first snapshot.vhd
REM (6) Thus far I'm assuming that image.vhd is on drive C:, I THINK that's safe
REM 
REM
REM assumes that \snapshot.vhd is on C:, which will be
REM C: when running Win 7)
REM
REM first verify there's a file \image.vhd on the current drive
REM and use the drive letter %vdrive% to stop people from running the
REM script from Windows 7 accidentally
