	rem	FUNCTION:
	rem Merges files snapshot.vhd and image.vhd into image.vhd Here are
	rem the detailed steps.
	rem 1) Gets information about the existence of image.vhd and
	rem 	snapshot.vhd from startnet
	rem 2) Merges the two files
	rem 3) Deletes the old snapshot.vhd
	rem 4) Creates a new empty snapshot.vhd -- no BCD work required.
	rem
	rem SETUP:
	rem	assumes we've booted to the onboard SRS Tools WinPE (X:)
	rem assumes that \snapshot.vhd is on the same drive as WinPE's running (X: now, C: when rebooted to Win 7)
	rem
	rem if we got here, time to get to work: merge the files, delete the old snapshot, create a new one.
	rem
	echo.
	echo Found base image and snapshot files.  Merging files... (This can take a while,
	echo and Diskpart will offer "100 percent" for progress information, BUT the wait
	echo to finish merging the VHDs AFTER that "100 percent" message can be one to seven
	echo minutes depending on disk speeds, memory, the volume of changes etc.)
