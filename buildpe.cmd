	rem	Steadier State to a system
	rem End product:  an ISO folder and optionally puts it on a USB
	rem	stick.
	rem
	rem Assumes:ADK installed in default location
	rem		Can create and delete a folder %temp%\SrS
	rem	Inputs:	Which version of OS to use, Win 7, 8, 10, etc.
	rem		Which architecture to use, 32 or 64 bit
	rem			Where to write the ISO for a CD if desired
	rem			Drive letter of the USB stick to create if desired
	rem
	rem ADK LOCATION
	rem	Needs Windows ADK installed in its default location. If
	rem	that's an issue, change the "_adkbase" variable to point to the
	rem		top level folder wherever the ADK is installed. This script was
	rem		designed to use Windows 10 ADK, which can be installed and used
	rem		on any Windows 7 or newer system. If it is not found, we will
	rem		ask to install it. Previous versions are listed here as well,
	rem		but are untested and should not be used with this script.
