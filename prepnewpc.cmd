	echo How and Why To Use PREPNEWPC in Steadier State
	echo --------------------------------------------
	echo.
	echo Steadier State lets you create a "snapshot" of a Windows
	echo installation so that you can choose at any time to reboot your
	echo Windows system, choose "Roll Back Windows," and at that point
	echo every change you've made to the system is un-done. To do that,
	echo however, Steadier State requires you to prepare your Windows
	echo system, and PREPNEWPC does that for you.
	echo.
	echo To get a system ready for conversion, first boot it from your
	echo Steadier State USB/DVD.  Then, connect the system to some large
	echo external drive, whether it's a networked drive mapped to a
	echo drive letter or perhaps a large external hard disk -- you'll
	echo need that because you're going to take the VHD file that you
	echo created with CVT2VHD. On the USB stick/DVD, you'll see a file
	echo named prepnewpc.cmd
	echo.
	echo That'll take a while, but when it's done, the vhd file will be
	echo copied from the external drive to your C: drive. Once you've got
	echo that image.vhd on the C: drive you can boot a system to get it
	echo ready to be able to use that VHD.  You can do it by simply
	echo restarting your computer.
