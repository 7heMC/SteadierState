echo How and Why To Use PREPNEWPC in Steadier State
echo --------------------------------------------
echo.
echo Steadier State lets you create a "snapshot" of a Windows
echo installation so that you can choose at any time to reboot
echo your Windows system, choose "Roll Back Windows," and at
echo that point every change you've made to the system is un-done.
echo To do that, however, Steadier State requires you to prepare
echo your Windows system, and PREPNEWPC does that for you.
echo.
echo To get a system ready for conversion, first boot it from
echo your SDRState bootable USB stick or CD.  Then, connect
echo the system to some large external drive, whether it's a 
echo networked drive mapped to a drive letter or perhaps a large
echo external hard disk -- you'll need that because you're going
echo to take the VHD file that you created with CVT2VHD.
echo On the USB stick/CD, you'll see a file named
echo prepnewpc.cmd
echo.
echo That'll take a while, but when it's done, the vhd file
echo will be moved from the external drive to your C: drive.
echo Once you've got that image.vhd on the C: drive you can boot
echo a system to get it ready to be able to use that VHD.  You can
echo to it by simply restarting your computer.
