To Sysprep a working Windows 7 system:

1) Log onto the system as an administrator.
2) Open an elevated command prompt (right-click Command Prompt, choose Run as Administrator, confirm the UAC prompt).
3) navigate to \windows\system32\sysprep.  As you enter the command prompt at \windows\system32, in most cases you just type

cd sysprep


4) Locate the XML file sysprep64.xml or sysprep32.xml.  Let's say that it's on drive G:\.

5) Type

sysprep /oobe /generalize /shutdown /unattend:g:\sysprepXX.xml

Where "XX" is either "32" or "64," depending on which architecture you're using.

6) Wait for Sysprep to finish running.

DO NOT LET THE SYSTEM BOOT FROM THE HARD DISK at this point.  Boot it from a Steadier State USB stick.
