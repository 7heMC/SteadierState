echo Hi.  I see that you've prepared this computer's hard disk to use Steadier
echo State, but haven't yet put an image on C:.
echo.
echo Steadier State depends on a system image named image.vhd residing on your
echo large partition, what is probably drive C:.  Please get an image.vhd and put
echo it on C: before going any further.
echo.
echo If you DON'T have an image.vhd yet, it's easy to make one.  Just get a
echo Windows 7 Ultimate/Enterprise or any version of Windows Server 2008 R2
echo exactly as you want it, then boot that system with your Steadier State USB
echo stick or CD.  Run the command "cvt2vhd" and follow the instructions that'll
echo appear on the screen.  Once you've got your image.vhd copied to C:\, then run
echo "rollback"  from the command line and it'll get your snapshot set up so that
echo you can use Steadier State to instantly roll back your computer to a 
echo snapshot.  Thanks!
echo.
echo Thanks for using Steadier State, I hope it's helpful.

echo To roll back your copy of Windows to when you created its last snapshot, type

echo rollback

echo and press Enter.  Once it finishes running, just reboot. 
echo.
echo If you want to keep the changes that you've made to your system since the last

echo if you ever DO want to see this command prompt window when "Roll Back Windows"
echo is chosen, create a file named "noauto.txt" in the root of any drive letter
echo between C: and L:.  (See the documentation for more details on noauto.txt.)
