echo How and Why To Use CVT2VHD in Steadier State
echo --------------------------------------------
echo.
echo Steadier State lets you create a "snapshot" of a Windows
echo installation so that you can choose at any time to reboot
echo your Windows system, choose "Roll Back Windows," and at
echo that point every change you've made to the system is un-done.
echo To do that, however, Steadier State requires you to convert
echo your Windows system to a VHD file, and CVT2VHD does that 
echo for you.
echo.
echo To get a system ready for conversion, first boot it from
echo your SteadierState bootable USB stick or CD.  Then, connect
echo the system to some large external drive, whether it's a 
echo networked drive mapped to a drive letter or perhaps a large
echo external hard disk -- you'll need that because you're going
echo to take that system's C: drive and rebuild it as one large
echo VHD file.  On the USB stick/CD, you'll see a file named
echo cvt2vhd.cmd.  
echo.
echo This'll take a while, but when it's done, you'll have a file
echo named image.vhd on your target drive. Once you've got the
echo image.vhd, you're ready to prep a system to get it ready to 
echo be able to use that VHD.  You can do that by booting the system
echo with your USB stick/CD and then running prepnewpc. Or if you
echo want to deploy it on this machine simply use run the prepnewpc
echo command once this is complete.
echo.
echo Thanks for using Steadier State, I hope it's of value.

echo should have an amount of free space equal to at least 2.5 times the

REM
REM and now we're done, it's in image.vhd
REM
echo Completed creating your image.vhd.  To deploy this to a PC, you should:
echo.
echo  1) Boot the target PC with your Steadier State USB stick/CD.
echo  2) Run prepnewpc on the target PC (which will wipe the hard drive of that
echo     system, so if there's anything you care about on that target PC, back
echo     it up first)!
echo  3) Your target PC will now have a large empty C: drive.  Copy this image.vhd
echo     that you've just created to the root of that C:\ drive.
echo  4) Once image.vhd has copied, remove the USB stick/CD and reboot the PC from
echo     its hard drive.  When you reboot, Steadier State will determine that your
echo     system needs a snapshot file and an OS boot entry, so it creates those
echo     things and automatically reboots again.  Let it do its work and reboot and
echo     your system will soon boot up in Windows 7, but at that point you'll be
echo     protected by Steadier State -- whenever you want your system to forget
echo     everything done to it since now, just reboot and at Boot Manager, choose 
echo     "Roll Back Windows."

:needinputs
echo.
echo This script needs three inputs: the drive letter you want 
echo to image, like C:, the drive letter with sufficient space
echo to let you create the image, and the size of the VHD
echo file you want, in gigabytes.  So, for example, if you typed
echo.
echo cvt2vhd e: g: 80
echo.
echo Then cvt2vhd would image drive E: as image.vhd onto drive G:,
echo creating an image.vhd file that can expand as large as 80 GB.
echo.
echo NOTE:  the physical hard disk that you deploy the resulting
echo image.vhd onto should be at least 2.5 times the VHD file size
echo that you specified, so, for example, in the above case the 
echo image.vhd file you've capped at 80 GB should be deployed to a
echo physical volume that has at least 2.5x80 or 200 GB free.
echo.
